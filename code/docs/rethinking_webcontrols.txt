Better (and more REST) pattern could be:
"<option>://<resource>/<resource-id>"
Body (almost):
"<parameter>=<value>\n
<parameter>=<value>\n
..."
Last dublicate parameter wins!

"get://configuration"
Will print the configuration. Don't print secrets like the WIFI-passphrase!

"patch://configuration"
Body:
"<parameter>=<value>\n
<parameter>=<value>\n
..."
Might be available in future to change specific (changeable!) configuration parameters.

"get://documentation"
Will print the documentation of the available commands and their usage.

"patch://servos"
Body:
"action=enable"
Will enable all servos

"patch://servos"
Body:
"action=disable"
Will disable all servos

"patch://servos/fll"
Body:
"action=enable"
With fll meaning front-left-lift(-servo), enabling the lifting-servo on the front-left-leg

"patch://servos/flt"
Body:
"action=disable"
with flt meaning front-left-turn(-servo), disabling the turning-servo on the front-left-leg

"patch://servos/frl"
Body:
"action=enable"

"patch://servos/frt"
Body:
"action=disable"

"patch://servos/fll"
Body:
"action=rotate\n
angle=90"
Will rotate the front-left-lifting-servo to 90Â°-position (absolute)

"patch://servos"
Body:
"fll090frl120bll010brl030flt000frt045blt045brt090\n
fll090frl120blt045brt090\n
flt000"
Will play a macro line by line changing the specified servo-angles (absolute). All at ones, only some, only one.
Allows sending patterns to be done without programming them into the robot.

Note: One might come to the idea doing relative actions, but ...
... this would need an extra parameter type=relative (OK)
... this would need to save the current position (OK)
    ... what might lead to problems, because the configuration has to be perfect about maximum angles in all directions (PROBLEMATIC)
        ... otherwise the values will be increased above the maximum/decreased below the minimum physical possible angle (VERY BAD)
... this would need to handle signs before the angle-value (OK)

We don't use POST, PUT and DELETE, because we don't create or delete anything yet. Maybe later when saving data to the robot!?
"delete://configuration" might be used for resetting specific configuration-values to defaults in future.
"options://" might be available in future to show what options we accept.
CONNECT, HEAD and TRACE are useless (do not see a valid action for this at the moment)
